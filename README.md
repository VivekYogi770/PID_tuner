# PID_tuner
A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) tuner using machine learning is an advanced method for optimizing the parameters of PID controllers, which are widely used in industrial control systems. Here's a brief overview:

What is a PID Controller?
A PID controller is a control loop mechanism that uses three parameters:

* Proportional (P) : Determines the reaction to the current error.
* Integral (I)     : Determines the reaction based on the sum of past errors.
* Derivative (D)   : Predicts future errors based on the rate of change.
  
Machine Learning for PID Tuning
Traditional PID tuning methods can be time-consuming and may not always yield optimal results, especially for complex or nonlinear systems. Machine learning offers a more efficient and effective approach:



**Benefits**
* Improved Performance: Machine learning-based PID tuning can handle complex, nonlinear systems better than traditional methods.
* Adaptability: These methods can adapt to changing system dynamics in real-time.
* Efficiency: Faster and more accurate tuning compared to manual methods.
* 
**Applications**
* Industrial Automation: Enhancing the control of machinery and processes.
* Biotechnology: Managing complex bioprocesses with nonlinear dynamics.
* Robotics: Improving the precision and stability of robotic movements.
